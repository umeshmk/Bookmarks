## What ?

Finest collection of utilitarian websites for web developers.

## Why ?

_"To make a right choice we must be aware of what options we have."_

We often get lost in search engine, Blogs, Videos, Books, etc. Each individual with its own perceptions often creates a vague picture. I have tried to to make things crystal clear by using metrics - Domain ranking & GitHub Stargazers.

## When ?

Javascript & Html are topping the charts of every developers survey on internet for years. This was long overdue. I'm glad to take initiative.

## Where ?

Open source & hosted on GitHub pages.

## How ?

Made mistakes & learnt from them.
How big this could get if the community share their experiences on great resources ?
