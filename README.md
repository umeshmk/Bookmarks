## What ?
Finest collection of utilitarian websites for web developers.

## Why ?
"To make a right choice we must be aware of what options we have." We often get lost in  search engine, Blogs, Videos, Books, etc. Each individual with its own perceptions often creates a vague picture. I have tried to to make things crystal clear by using metrics - Domain ranking & GitHub Stargazers.

## When ?
Javascript & Html are topping the charts of every developers survey on internet for years. This was long overdue. I'm glad to take initiative.

## Where ?
Open source & hosted on GitHub pages.

## How ?
Made mistakes & learnt from them.
How big this could get if the community share their experiences on great resources ?

## Contribution
Just create or comment on issues.
